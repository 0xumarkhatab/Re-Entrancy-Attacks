# Re Entrancy Attack

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install
npx hardhat test

```

See the code in `contracts` Directory for better explanation
